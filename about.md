# About me

Hello! 👋 

It is now fashionable again to have a small bio in one’s website, so here’s some stuff about me. 

My name is Kostis Gourgoulias and I’m a research scientist in the AI group of [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/). I mostly think about uncertainty quantification and its place in the age of machine-learned models. I particularly like tools from information theory and stochastic processes. Some questions that form the basis of my current research are:

- How can we make decisions with confidence when our model speaks a language we don’t understand? 
- Can our models “jump” to accurate conclusions from less data than we currently use? 
- How can a model learn and infer at the same time, self-correcting itself while on the job?



I graduated from UMass Amherst with a PhD in Applied Mathematics and, before that, with a BSc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Crete.
