# About me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kostis Gourgoulias and, since March 2022, Iâ€™m a research scientist / ML lead at [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence). Before that, I was a senior research scientist in the AI group of [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/).

## Research

At JPMorgan, I currently lead a few research directions on using language modeling to assist with Q&A, summarisation, anomaly detection, and code diagnostics. 

At Babylon, I worked on applications of machine learning to medical diagnostics and automated decision-making. My work has appeared in a few publications and patents; you can find a few of them on the [research post]({{site.url}}/Research/) on this site or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V1S7npsAAAAJ&hl=en) (scholar is more up-to-date). 

## Education

I graduated from UMass Amherst with a PhD in (Applied) Mathematics in 2017, where I was lucky to be advised by Professors Markos Katsoulakis and Luc Rey-Bellet. My thesis was titled "Information metrics for predictive modeling and machine learning." and can be found at [UMass Scholarworks](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1006/). 

I also hold a BSc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Crete.

## Trivia

- [My math genealogy page](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=228804).

- During my PhD, I co-founded and co-chaired the [GRiD](https://github.com/gridclub) (Graduate Researchers in Data) group at UMass. 

- I like to [write](https://www.quora.com/profile/Kostis-Gourgoulias) about science and explain [whatever](https://inlieuofabettertitle.wordpress.com/) I find [interesting](https://github.com/kgourgou/Linear-Perceptron), especially in the fields of math that interest me. You can find more examples in [my blog](http://kgourgou.me).

- I have been learning how to play the piano for the last six years.
