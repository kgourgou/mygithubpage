# About me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

It is now fashionable again to have a small bio on oneâ€™s website, so hereâ€™s some stuff about me.

My name is Kostis and Iâ€™m a senior research scientist in the AI group of [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/). At Babylon, I work on applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to diagnostics and automated-decision making.

For more about my research, see the [research post]({{site.url}}/Research/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V1S7npsAAAAJ&hl=en) (scholar is more up-to-date).


## Education

I graduated from UMass Amherst with a PhD in (Applied) Mathematics in 2017, advised by Professor Markos Katsoulakis and Professor Luc Rey-Bellet. My thesis was titled "information metrics for predictive modeling and machine learning" and can be found at [UMass Scholarworks](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1006/).

Before UMass, I graduated from the University of Crete with a BSc. in Applied Mathematics.
