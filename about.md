# About me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

It is now fashionable again to have a small bio in oneâ€™s website, so hereâ€™s some stuff about me. 

My name is Kostis and Iâ€™m a research scientist in the AI group of [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/). I mostly think about uncertainty quantification and its place in the age of machine-learned models. I particularly like tools from information theory and stochastic processes, but I try to keep in an open mind. 

I graduated from UMass Amherst with a PhD in Applied Mathematics and, 
before that, with a BSc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Crete.
