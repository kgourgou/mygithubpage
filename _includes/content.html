<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I am a <b>fifth year Ph.D student</b> at UMass Amherst, in the  Department of Mathematics & Statistics.

I am co-advised by Professor <a href="http://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/">Markos Katsoulakis</a> and Professor <a href="http://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/">Luc Rey-Bellet</a>.
</p>


<h2>My Research</h2>

<p>
Currently, I'm trying to learn more about systems in molecular dynamics and the schemes
    involved in their simulation. 
</p>

<p>
The point of contact of the different projects I am working on is to employ <b>tools from information theory</b> in new ways to <b>generate insights</b> and <b>quantify uncertainties.</b>

    Researchers interested in Data (GRiD) group</a>. I served as <b>Co-Chair</b>
    of the group during the fall semester of 2014 and the spring semester of
    2015. As a Co-Chair, I helped organize <a
