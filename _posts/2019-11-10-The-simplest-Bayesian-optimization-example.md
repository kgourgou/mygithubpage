After a really interesting paper discussion session, [I decided to implement](https://github.com/kgourgou/baeysian-opt-for-fun) Bayesian-opt. with the `expected-improvement` acquisition function. I’ve already fixed a few bugs, but can’t promise it is bug-free. It will probably work as long as you stick to my examples.
