Just a short post on past and current research.

A theme of my research has been about the various uncertainties in the data and how those affect the rest of the modeling process, e.g., the selection of a parametric vs non-parametric family for fitting, the metrics used, etc. What mathematical tools do we need to be able to carry out inference confidently when almost every component of the model is noisy?

The titles of a few papers I have published are below. You can find a more up-to-date list on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V1S7npsAAAAJ&hl=en) which also includes a list of patents I have authored with colleagues from Babylon Health.
